All the available data for each reference genome is easily found through
their Overview page. From the BnaOmics homepage, these are accessed
either by selecting them in the Major Varieties menu in the toolbar.

On each Reference Genomes Overview page, there are two main sections.
The left side toolbar is static and has a Data section and a Tools
section. The links in these sections either change the information to
the right of the toolbar, or open another tab with the linked
information. Major Varieties Overview pages default to the Overview
section which contains basic information and a summary of related
BnaOmics data.
