The Genes and Transcripts Search allows you to search sequences
available in BnaOmics using different parameters. Some parameters return
a broad range of results, while others can be used to find very specific
data. All genes/transcripts for a species can be selected and either
viewed together or filtered by name and/or location. Searches can also
be limited to datasets, such as genome. Users can also customize the
search results by selecting BLAST, InterPro and/or Go Term.

All search results are returned as a table with hyperlinks to more
information. The table can be downloaded, as well as a Fasta file of the
returned sequences. To do another search, click reset.
