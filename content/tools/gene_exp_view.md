The Gene Expression View allows you to view

:   (1) gene expression in [1234
        libraries](https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/exp-view/meta_samples.php)
        and 9 different tissues under pan-genome context covering 3
        distinct developmental stages during its life cycle, including
        callus, cotyledon, root, stem peel, leaf, bud, flower, silique,
        silique wall and seed. Especially, there exist 26 and 23 time
        points in seed and silique wall respectively and 24 leaf
        developmental time points, with 2 day intervals.
    (2) view population gene expression of B. napus 219 germplasms in
        shoot apical meristem (SAM) and silique tissues.
